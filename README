Code coverage

To perform code coverage analysism do the following:

cd bin

Logging
-------
To enable more verbose logging while running an application like the demo use GLOG_v environment variable.

There are 4 levels of verbosity used:
1 - logs that appear only once
2 - logs that appear seldom
3 - logs that may appear every frame
4 - logs that may appear multiple times per frame

example: GLOG_v=4 ./Demo
